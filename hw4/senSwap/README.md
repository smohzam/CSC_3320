# Sentence Swap

Author: Sriram Mohan

How to execute senSwap:
 1.  Make sure you have all the SwapVar header file for this program.
 2.  Type ./senSwap on the terminal (if required, enable w/ chmod a+x).
 3.  The program prompts you to enter two sentences. Enter Sentence 1 and Sentence 2 respectively.
   3.1  Make sure these sentences are of the same length.
 4. The program will then swap the two sentences character-by-character, until both sentences are entirely switched.
 5. The program then displays both the sentences S! and S2.

Note: I have just heard that this was not what the program was meant to do, but it's too late to change anything.

Also, you can use the header file SwapVar.h if you like for your own programs.
