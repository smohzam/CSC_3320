# Country Codes

Author: Sriram Mohan

How to execute countryCodes:
  1. 	Compile the program and type ./CountryCodes on the terminal (if required, enable w/ chmod a+x).
  2.	The program has an array of country codes for international dialing with about 20 entries.
  3.  The program prompts you to enter a country code, and it will look it up for you.
  3.  Because country codes can be written in many formats, the code can be read upto 3 characters.
  4.  If the code you have entered is there, it will return its respective country name.
  5.  Else, it will display "Entry does not Exist."
