# Find String

Author: Sriram Mohan

How to execute findStr:
  1. Compile the program and type ./findStr on the terminal (if required, enable w/ chmod a+x).
  2. The program will ask you enter a word. You can enter any word you like and as many as you like as well, as long as its length is not equal to 4.
    2.1 When its length is equal to 4, that word will be the last to be entered, after which the program starts to finish.
  3. As you keep entering words, the program keeps track of the first and last words that come in the dictionary (largest and smallest in alphabetical order).
  4. Once the program finishes after you have entered a 4-letter word, it displays the alphabetically largest and smallest words as per the dictionary.
  
  Note: The program does not keep track of largest and smallest words in terms of length.
