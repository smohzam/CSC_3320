Author: Sriram Mohan

How to execute reader:
1.	Make sure you have all the source C-files and makefiles for this program.
2.	Also make sure you have source file from which you want to read.
3.  Type ./reader on the terminal followed by the source file name and the destination file to which you wish save the output (if required, enable w/ chmod a+x).
  	If you already have created a text file, you can use that as your destination.
    Otherwise, the program will create one for you with the name you specify as the destination.
4.	You can execute this command multiple times and it will append to that file.

If you haven’t compiled the program yet, do the following:
1.	Make sure you have files makefile.mk, problem5char.c, problem5words.c,  problem5lines.c, and reader.c.
2.	Type ‘make problem5char.o’ on the terminal.
3.	Type ‘make problem5words.o’ on the terminal.
4.	Type ‘make ‘problem5lines.o’ on the terminal.
5.	Type ‘make reader.o’ on the terminal.
6.	Type ‘make reader’ on the terminal.
7.	Check for the existence of reader. It should be there and executable.
