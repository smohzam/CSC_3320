# Numeric Sort

Author: Sriram Mohan

How to execute numericSort:
1.	Compile the program and type ./NumericSort on the terminal (if required, enable w/ chmod a+x).
2.	The program has an array of floats. It asks you whether you want to sort it in ascending or descending order.
3.	Type on ‘A’ to sort in ascending, or type ‘D’ to sort in descending.
4.	You can also type in lowercase – the program accepts that.
5.	If you type in any other character, the program will not accept it, and will prompt you to enter ‘A’ or ‘D’ again.
6.	Once, you type ‘A’ or ‘D’, the array is sorted accordingly, and the program prints all of its elements.
