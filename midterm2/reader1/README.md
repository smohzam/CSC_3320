# Reader 1

Author: Sriram Mohan

How to execute reader1:
1.  Make sure you have all the reader.c file, its header files and makefiles for the program.
2.  Also make sure you have source file from which you want to read.
3.  Type ./reader1 on the terminal followed by the source file name and the destination file to which you wish save the output (if required, enable w/ chmod a+x).

    If you already have created a text file, you can use that as your destination.
    Otherwise, the program will create one for you with the name you specify as the destination.
  
4.  You can execute this command multiple times and it will append to that file.


If you haven’t compiled the program yet, do the following:
1.	Make sure you have files makefile1.mk, problem6char.h, problem6words.h,  problem6lines.h, and reader1.c.
2.	Type ‘make reader1.o’ on the terminal.
3.	Type ‘make reader1’ on the terminal.
4.	Check for the existence of reader. It should be there and executable.
