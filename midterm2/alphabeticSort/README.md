# Alphabetic Sort

Author: Sriram Mohan

How to execute AlphabeticSort:
1.	Compile the program and type ./alphabeticSort on the terminal (if required, enable w/ chmod a+x).
2.	The program has an array of Strings. It asks you whether you want to sort it in ascending or descending order.
3.  Type ‘A’ to sort in ascending, or type ‘D’ to sort in descending.
4.	If you type in any other character, the program will not accept it, and will prompt you to enter ‘A’ or ‘D’ again.
5.	Once, you type ‘A’ or ‘D’, the array is sorted accordingly, and the program prints all of its elements.
6.	Spaces and newline characters are not a problem. You just have to enter the correct input.
7.	You can also type in lowercase – the program accepts that.
