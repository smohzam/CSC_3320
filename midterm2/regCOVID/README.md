Author: Sriram Mohan

How to execute regCOVID:
1.	Compile the program and type ./regCOVID on the terminal (if required, enable w/ chmod a+x).
2.The program displays a menu. This menu has two options: Register (R) and Exit (X).
3.	Type ‘R’ to register or ‘X’ to exit.
4.	If you type in any other character, the program ignores it, and it just stays on the menu.
  
  [If you type R]: 
  1 The program will open the registry.
  2 It will start asking you to enter your first name, last name, date of birth, dose number, date of previous dose, type of vaccine, and ZIP code.
  3 Based on that information, the program enters your details into the database.
	4 It also generates a code for you, based on your name, age, type of vaccine, and ZIP code.
  5 It displays this code along with your details.
  6 It then redirects back to the menu.
  
  [If you type ‘X’]: the program quits.
  
5.	You can also type in lowercase – the program accepts that.
6.	Spaces and newline characters are not a problem. You just have to enter the correct input.
