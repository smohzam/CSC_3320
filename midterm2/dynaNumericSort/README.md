# Dynamic Numeric Sort

Author: Sriram Mohan

How to execute dynaNumericSort:
1.	Compile the program and type ./dynaNumericSort on the terminal (if required, enable w/ chmod a+x).
2.	The program runs creating an array, initially with 0 elements.
3.	The program asks you to enter an element or quit. Type ‘A’ to add an element, or type ‘Q’ to quit.
4.	If you type in any other character, the program ignores it, and asks you to type ‘A’ or ‘Q’ again.
5.	If you type A, the program will prompt you to enter a float. Enter your element.
6.	Once you have entered, that element is pushed into the array, as its length is increased by 1.
7.	You can repeat the above 2 steps until you enter ‘Q’.
8.	If you have hit ‘Q’ and there are no elements in the array, the program displays the message: "Array is empty."
9.	Else, it asks you whether you want to sort it in ascending or descending order. Type ‘A’ to sort in ascending, or type ‘D’ to sort in descending.
10.	If you type in any other character, the program will not accept it, and will prompt you to enter ‘A’ or ‘D’ again.
11.	Once, you type ‘A’ or ‘D’, the array is sorted accordingly, and the program prints all of its elements.
12.	Spaces and newline characters are not a problem. You just have to enter the correct input.
13.	You can also type in lowercase – the program accepts that.
