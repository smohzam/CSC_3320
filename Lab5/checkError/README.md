# Check Error

Author: Sriram Mohan

Description:

What was meant to just be a program that had some errors to be removed, now works perfectly and does the following:
  1. It prints "Try to find some errors!!!"
     It also prints Try to find out some errors!!!"
  2. It searches for the words which can be matched by regex the words which can be matched by regex '[^a]\*ce' from the following list: 
     lance
     ace
     brace
     decide
     piece
  3. It wrties the output to a file called Result and checks the existence of Result.
  4. It asks for your email address, and upon entering sends the content of Result to your email.
  5. It lastly prints out: "Congratulations! You have corrected all the errors!"

The file can be executed by typing ./checkError.sh on the terminal (if required, enable w/ chmod a+x).
