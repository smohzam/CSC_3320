# Calc

Author : Sriram Mohan

How to execute calc:
1.	Type ./calc on the terminal (if required, enable w/ chmod a+x).
2.  The terminal saying “type number (C to cancel), will ask you to enter a first number.
3.	Then, it will say “type operand: +, -, x, /, %, =, C” , which will only perform those operations, and if invalid character is displayed, the output will display “invalid”.
4.	If ‘=’ is typed, the result will be returned as the first entry.
5.	If ‘C’ is typed, the result will be returned as 0.
6.	Else, the terminal saying “type number (C to cancel), will ask you to enter the second number.
7.	If ‘+’ , ‘-’ , ‘/’ , ‘x’, or ‘%’ is typed, the calculator will return the sum, difference, quotient, product, or remainder, respectively.
Else the result will return as invalid.
