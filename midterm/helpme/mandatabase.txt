NAME
       rm - remove files or directories

SYNOPSIS
       rm [OPTION]... FILE...

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual page documents the GNU version of rm.  rm removes each specified file.  By default, it does not
       remove directories.

       If the -I or --interactive=once option is given, and there are more than three  files  or  the  -r,  -R,  or
       --recursive  are  given,  then rm prompts the user for whether to proceed with the entire operation.  If the
       response is not affirmative, the entire command is aborted.

       Otherwise, if a file is unwritable, standard input is a terminal, and the -f or --force option is not given,
       or  the  -i or --interactive=always option is given, rm prompts the user for whether to remove the file.  If
       the response is not affirmative, the file is skipped.

OPTIONS
       Remove (unlink) the FILE(s).

       -f, --force
              ignore nonexistent files and arguments, never prompt

       -i     prompt before every removal
       -I     prompt once before removing more than three files, or when removing recursively; less intrusive  than
              -i, while still giving protection against most mistakes

       --interactive[=WHEN]
              prompt according to WHEN: never, once (-I), or always (-i); without WHEN, prompt always

       --one-file-system
              when  removing  a  hierarchy  recursively, skip any directory that is on a file system different from
              that of the corresponding command line argument

       --no-preserve-root
              do not treat '/' specially

       --preserve-root
              do not remove '/' (default)

       -r, -R, --recursive
              remove directories and their contents recursively

       -d, --dir
              remove empty directories

       -v, --verbose
              explain what is being done

       --help display this help and exit

       --version

       --no-preserve-root
              do not treat '/' specially

       --preserve-root
              do not remove '/' (default)

       -r, -R, --recursive
              remove directories and their contents recursively

       -d, --dir
              remove empty directories

       -v, --verbose
              explain what is being done

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       By default, rm does not remove directories.  Use the --recursive (-r or -R) option  to  remove  each  listed
       directory, too, along with all of its contents.

       To remove a file whose name starts with a '-', for example '-foo', use one of these commands:

              rm -- -foo

              rm ./-foo

       Note that if you use rm to remove a file, it might be possible to recover some of its contents, given suffi‐
       cient expertise and/or time.  For greater assurance that the  contents  are  truly  unrecoverable,  consider
       using shred.

NAME
       chmod - change file mode bits

SYNOPSIS
       chmod [OPTION]... MODE[,MODE]... FILE...
       chmod [OPTION]... OCTAL-MODE FILE...
       chmod [OPTION]... --reference=RFILE FILE...

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  documents the GNU version of chmod.  chmod changes the file mode bits of each given file
       according to mode, which can be either a symbolic representation of changes to make, or an octal number rep‐
       resenting the bit pattern for the new mode bits.

       The  format  of a symbolic mode is [ugoa...][[+-=][perms...]...], where perms is either zero or more letters
       from the set rwxXst, or a single letter from the set ugo.  Multiple symbolic modes can be  given,  separated
       by commas.

       A  combination  of  the  letters ugoa controls which users' access to the file will be changed: the user who
       owns it (u), other users in the file's group (g), other users not in the file's group (o), or all users (a).
       If  none  of  these  are given, the effect is as if a were given, but bits that are set in the umask are not
       affected.

       The operator + causes the selected file mode bits to be added to the existing file mode bits of each file; -
       causes  them  to  be removed; and = causes them to be added and causes unmentioned bits to be removed except
       that a directory's unmentioned set user and group ID bits are not affected.
       The letters rwxXst select file mode bits for the affected users: read (r), write (w), execute (or search for
       directories)  (x), execute/search only if the file is a directory or already has execute permission for some
       user (X), set user or group ID on execution (s), restricted deletion flag or sticky bit (t).  Instead of one
       or  more  of  these  letters, you can specify exactly one of the letters ugo: the permissions granted to the
       user who owns the file (u), the permissions granted to other users who are members of the file's group  (g),
       and the permissions granted to users that are in neither of the two preceding categories (o).

       A  numeric  mode is from one to four octal digits (0-7), derived by adding up the bits with values 4, 2, and
       1.  Omitted digits are assumed to be leading zeros.  The first digit selects the set user  ID  (4)  and  set
       group ID (2) and restricted deletion or sticky (1) attributes.  The second digit selects permissions for the
       user who owns the file: read (4), write (2), and execute (1); the third selects permissions for other  users
       in  the file's group, with the same values; and the fourth for other users not in the file's group, with the
       same values.

       chmod never changes the permissions of symbolic links; the chmod system call  cannot  change  their  permis‐
       sions.   This  is  not  a problem since the permissions of symbolic links are never used.  However, for each
       symbolic link listed on the command line, chmod changes the permissions of the  pointed-to  file.   In  con‐
       trast, chmod ignores symbolic links encountered during recursive directory traversals.

SETUID AND SETGID BITS
       chmod  clears the set-group-ID bit of a regular file if the file's group ID does not match the user's effec‐
       tive group ID or one of the user's supplementary group IDs, unless  the  user  has  appropriate  privileges.
       Additional  restrictions  may  cause  the  set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits of MODE or RFILE to be ignored.
       This behavior depends on the policy and functionality of the underlying chmod system call.  When  in  doubt,
       check the underlying system behavior.

       chmod  preserves  a  directory's  set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits unless you explicitly specify otherwise.
       You can set or clear the bits with symbolic modes like u+s and g-s, and you can set (but not clear) the bits
       with a numeric mode.

RESTRICTED DELETION FLAG OR STICKY BIT
       The  restricted  deletion flag or sticky bit is a single bit, whose interpretation depends on the file type.
       For directories, it prevents unprivileged users from removing or renaming a file  in  the  directory  unless
       they  own  the  file or the directory; this is called the restricted deletion flag for the directory, and is
       commonly found on world-writable directories like /tmp.  For regular files on some older  systems,  the  bit
       saves  the program's text image on the swap device so it will load more quickly when run; this is called the
       sticky bit.

OPTIONS
       Change the mode of each FILE to MODE.  With --reference, change the mode of each FILE to that of RFILE.

       -c, --changes
              like verbose but report only when a change is made

       -f, --silent, --quiet
              suppress most error messages

       -v, --verbose
              output a diagnostic for every file processed

       --no-preserve-root
              do not treat '/' specially (the default)

       --preserve-root
              fail to operate recursively on '/'
       --reference=RFILE
              use RFILE's mode instead of MODE values

       -R, --recursive
              change files and directories recursively

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       Each MODE is of the form '[ugoa]*([-+=]([rwxXst]*|[ugo]))+|[-+=][0-7]+'.

NAME
       chgrp - change group ownership

SYNOPSIS
       chgrp [OPTION]... GROUP FILE...
       chgrp [OPTION]... --reference=RFILE FILE...

DESCRIPTION
       Change the group of each FILE to GROUP.  With --reference, change the group of each FILE to that of RFILE.

       -c, --changes
              like verbose but report only when a change is made

       -f, --silent, --quiet
              suppress most error messages

       -v, --verbose
              output a diagnostic for every file processed

       --dereference
              affect the referent of each symbolic link (this is the default), rather than the symbolic link itself

       -h, --no-dereference
              affect symbolic links instead of any referenced file (useful only on systems that can change the own‐
              ership of a symlink)
       --no-preserve-root
              do not treat '/' specially (the default)

       --preserve-root
              fail to operate recursively on '/'

       --reference=RFILE
              use RFILE's group rather than specifying a GROUP value

       -R, --recursive
              operate on files and directories recursively

       The following options modify how a hierarchy is traversed when the -R option is  also  specified.   If  more
       than one is specified, only the final one takes effect.

       -H     if a command line argument is a symbolic link to a directory, traverse it

       -L     traverse every symbolic link to a directory encountered

       -P     do not traverse any symbolic links (default)

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

EXAMPLES
       chgrp staff /u
EXAMPLES
       chgrp staff /u
              Change the group of /u to "staff".

       chgrp -hR staff /u
              Change the group of /u and subfiles to "staff".

GNU coreutils 8.22                                 November 2020                                           CHGRP(1)

SIZE(1)                                        GNU Development Tools                                        SIZE(1)

NAME
       size - list section sizes and total size.

SYNOPSIS
       size [-A|-B|--format=compatibility]
            [--help]
            [-d|-o|-x|--radix=number]
            [--common]
            [-t|--totals]
            [--target=bfdname] [-V|--version]
            [objfile...]

DESCRIPTION
       The GNU size utility lists the section sizes---and the total size---for each of the object or archive files
       objfile in its argument list.  By default, one line of output is generated for each object file or each
       module in an archive.

       objfile... are the object files to be examined.  If none are specified, the file "a.out" will be used.

OPTIONS
       The command line options have the following meanings:

       -A
       -B
       --format=compatibility
           Using one of these options, you can choose whether the output from GNU size resembles output from System
           V size (using -A, or --format=sysv), or Berkeley size (using -B, or --format=berkeley).  The default is
           the one-line format similar to Berkeley's.

           Here is an example of the Berkeley (default) format of output from size:

                   $ size --format=Berkeley ranlib size
                   text    data    bss     dec     hex     filename
                   294880  81920   11592   388392  5ed28   ranlib
                   294880  81920   11888   388688  5ee50   size

           This is the same data, but displayed closer to System V conventions:

                   $ size --format=SysV ranlib size
                   ranlib  :
                   section         size         addr
                   .text         294880         8192
                   .data          81920       303104
                   .bss           11592       385024
                   Total         388392

                   size  :
                   section         size         addr
                   .text         294880         8192
                   .data          81920       303104
                   .bss           11888       385024
                   Total         388688

       --help
           Show a summary of acceptable arguments and options.

       -d
       -o
       -x
       --radix=number
           Using one of these options, you can control whether the size of each section is given in decimal (-d, or
           --radix=10); octal (-o, or --radix=8); or hexadecimal (-x, or --radix=16).  In --radix=number, only the
           three values (8, 10, 16) are supported.  The total size is always given in two radices; decimal and
           hexadecimal for -d or -x output, or octal and hexadecimal if you're using -o.

       --common
           Print total size of common symbols in each file.  When using Berkeley format these are included in the
           bss size.

       -t
       --totals
           Show totals of all objects listed (Berkeley format listing mode only).

       --target=bfdname
           Specify that the object-code format for objfile is bfdname.  This option may not be necessary; size can
           automatically recognize many formats.

       -V
       --version
           Display the version number of size.

       @file
           automatically recognize many formats.

       -V
       --version
           Display the version number of size.

       @file
           Read command-line options from file.  The options read are inserted in place of the original @file
           option.  If file does not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be treated literally, and not
           removed.

           Options in file are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace character may be included in an option by
           surrounding the entire option in either single or double quotes.  Any character (including a backslash)
           may be included by prefixing the character to be included with a backslash.  The file may itself contain
           additional @file options; any such options will be processed recursively.

OPENVT(1)                                            Linux 1.x                                            OPENVT(1)

NAME
       openvt - start a program on a new virtual terminal (VT).

SYNOPSIS
       openvt [-c vtnumber] [OPTIONS] [--] command

DESCRIPTION
       openvt  will  find  the  first available VT, and run on it the given command with the given command options,
       standard input, output and error are directed to that terminal. The current search path ($PATH) is  used  to
       find the requested command. If no command is specified then the environment variable $SHELL is used.

   OPTIONS
       -c, --console=VTNUMBER
              Use  the given VT number and not the first available. Note you must have write access to the supplied
              VT for this to work;

       -f, --force
              Force opening a VT without checking whether it is already in use;

       -e, --exec
              Directly execute the given command, without forking.  This option is meant for use in /etc/inittab;

       -s, --switch
              Switch to the new VT when starting the command. The VT of the new command will be made the  new  cur‐
              rent VT;
       -u, --user
              Figure  out  the owner of the current VT, and run login as that user.  Suitable to be called by init.
              Shouldn't be used with -c or -l;

       -l, --login
              Make the command a login shell. A - is prepended to the name of the command to be executed;

       -v, --verbose
              Be a bit more verbose;

       -w, --wait
              wait for command to complete. If -w and -s are used together then openvt will switch back to the con‐
              trolling terminal when the command completes;

       -V, --version
              print program version and exit;

       -h, --help
              show this text and exit.

       --     end of options to openvt.

NOTE
       If  openvt  is  compiled with a getopt_long() and you wish to set options to the command to be run, then you
       must supply the end of options -- flag before the command.

EXAMPLES
       openvt can be used to start a shell on the next free VT, by using the command:

       openvt bash

       To start the shell as a login shell, use:

       openvt -l bash

       To get a long listing you must supply the -- separator:

       openvt -- ls -l

HISTORY
       Earlier, openvt was called open.  It was written by Jon  Tombs  <jon@gtex02.us.es  or  jon@robots.ox.ac.uk>.
       The -w idea is from "sam".
