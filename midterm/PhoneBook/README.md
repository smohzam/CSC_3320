# Phone Book

Author: Sriram Mohan

How to execute PhoneBook:
1. Type ./PhoneBook on the terminal (if required, enable w/ chmod a+x).
2. The menu displays 5 options: Add, Delete, Search, Edit, Quit

   [If Add is entered:]
   The program will ask for you to enter a name, address, and phone number, sequentially.
   These fields will be written to a file called phoneBook.txt. If it exists, they will be entered on a new line. If not, a new file will be created.
   
   [If Delete is entered:]
   The program will prompt you to enter a keyword.
   Any record with that specific keyword will be deleted.
 
   [If Search is entered:]
    The program will prompt you to enter a keyword.
    Any record with that specific keyword will be displayed.
    
   [If Edit is entered:]
   The program will prompt you to enter a keyword.
   It will then ask for an edit (replacement).
   All records with the keyword will be edited with the replacement.
 
   If Quit is entered, the program quits.

   If anything else is entered, it just stays on the menu.
